# QA Portfolio – Manual & Automation Testing Projects

This repository is a demonstration of my applied QA experience, such as manual testing, Selenium-based automation, data-driven testing, documentation.  The projects are based on actual test processes: requirement review, test design, test execution, defect reporting and writing automation scripts.
