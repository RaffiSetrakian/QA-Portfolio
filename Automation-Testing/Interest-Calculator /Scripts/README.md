# Script Notes

The automation script uses an Excel file for data-driven testing.  
Before running the script, update the file path in the code to match the location where you saved the Excel file.

Example:
excel_path = "/Users/your_username/Desktop/interest_data.xlsx"

Replace the path with your own system path before execution.
